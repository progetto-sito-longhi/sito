                            <p>Something had to be done with the product page in order to increase sales. So I decided to lose the full landing page template screenshot in favor of a square shaped cover image which allows for improved text arrangement benefiting both the user and SEO efforts. This move made room for the all important Recommended Templates section, introduced to help users browse templates easier and increase conversions.</p>

Up until now the user had the option to acquire templates individually but now he can get them all together in a huge value special offer package called Big Bundle.</p>
